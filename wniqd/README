wniqd
-----

wniqd is a simple user space programm for windows
and implement paetially RFC 4620. This programm is
intended to be used with ninsd which has to run on
a Linux system.

This version has to be compiled with cygwin and run
unter Windows XP SP3. Due to the absence of other
Windows systems, I what not able to test this on
Vista or Windows 7.

wniqd shall be installed as a service and must run
with administrator privilege.

Windows XP send router solicitation via multicast
addresses. Due to this, ninsd will not be able to
detect the presence of a new system. There are two
ways in order to get this working:

1) radvd can be configured for ignoring multicast
   solicitation ( flag UnicastOnly on )
2) ninsd can be instructed to periodically send
   a ping via multicast, the windows client will
   then respond to the icmp message and also send
   a beughbor advert. This can be enabled by the
   ninsd parameter "-e".

The most secure method is 2) but this implies
a lot of network traffic.

Build wniqd:
------------
Install cygwin and launch the "Cygwin Terminal"
and go to the directory where the wniqd source
are locates.
Type then make, the file wniqd will be compiled.

Installing wniqd as service:
----------------------------
Simply call "make install-service"

Deinstalling wniqd:
-------------------
open a  "Cygwin Terminal", go to the winqd directory
and type "make clean"
