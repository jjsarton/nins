You will find here a script (ipv6-sub.sh) which allow the
configuration of the name server, radvd and tayga

Furthermore this script allow you to start or stop the
local network configurations processes.

nins_update.sh is a wrapper script which can be called

getprefix is a little utility which send a router sollicitaion
on the given link, wait for the router advertisement and
finally print out the prefix for the subnet attached to
the link. With this value you may configure your system
with a static address while appending the prefix with
the interface ID eg 2 so that if the returned prefix
is 2001:db8:caffe:: the system can set the IPv5 address
to 2001:db8:caffe::2. gerprefix must be run as user root.
Please note that the network interface must be up. On
error getprefix  return 1 else 0.

In order to compile getprefix, simply call make getprefix.
For installtion of getprefix, copy the binary to a
directory as /usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin.

calcsubnet is an other little utility which allows to
print out a new prefix based on a delegated prefix
by adding an offset. If for example the CPE delegate
to you the / 62 subnet 2001:db8:dead:befc, calcsubnet
"-p 2001:db8:dead:befc:: -o 1" will return
2001:db8:dead:befd::.
You may also build an address if you add to the previous
call the id for the link eg "-i 3". In this case the result
will be 2001:db8:dead:befd::3. If the offset is not provided,
the result will be 2001:db8:dead:befc::3

In order to compile calcsubnet, simply call make getprefix.
For installtion of calcsubnet, copy the binary to a
directory as /usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin.
