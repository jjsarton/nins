		<h1>Ninsd an utility for DDNS with IPv6</h1>
		<h2>Client IP Adress assignement and routing</h2>
		<h3>IPv6 radvd/dhcpd v6</h3>
		<p>
			In order to provide routing information to the system within
			the LAN, the daemon <strong>radvd</strong> must be launched.
			With <strong>radvd</strong> the connected system can auto configure themselves
			(stateless mode) and a valid IPv6 Address based on the
			Mac Address of the interface or a temporary address which
			help to provide anonymity is generated. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The IPv6 Address can also be assigned by the <strong>dhcpd</strong> server.
			The routing informations are always to be provided by the
			router advertisement, the dhcp-v6 implememtation has some deficiencies.
		</p>
		<h2>Name resolution</h2>
		<p>
			If we have two system within the LAN (alice and bob)
			which offer different services we must use a name server
			which know the systems and therefore we need fixed addresses
            and an entry within the name service configuration.			
		</p>
		<h3>The DHCPv6 server</h3>
		<p>
			The DHCPv6 server don't presently allow to update the
			name server with the information about the attached systems.
			We will not be able, for example, to display a web page
			offered by alice by typing the URL http://alice.example.com
			on the bob system. We must enter a complicated IPv6 address
			in order to do this.<br>
			Further more passing routing informations don't work well
			at this time. This implies that for now the router advertisement
			daemon must be launched.
		</p>
		<h3>The avahi discovery system</h3>
		<p>
			On linux based system the avahi components allows to publish
			informations about the different services offered by the
			system. Avahi provide also a multicast DNS service which
			should allows to address the different systems on the LAN
			with there name e.g. alice.local or bob.local.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some aspect of the specification for these services are
			not very good and the adresses returned by the resolver
			library mdns are not OK or not available. Due to this
			avahi don't solve the DNS problem.
		</p>
		<h2>An icmp-v6 based approach</h2>
		<p>
			The system on the LAN communicate always via the Internet
			Control Message Protocol v6 in order to exchange information
			as, for example, the routing information send by radvd.
		</p>
		<p>
			The icmp-v6 protocol know a node information extention
			(ninfo) which can be used in order to get the name or
			the IPv6 addresses od the systems within the lan.
			Unfortunately this is not implemented within the Linux
			kernel.
		</p>
		<h3>The ninfod daemon</h3>
		<p>
			The requirements stated within rfc 4620 are fullfilled
			by the daemon ninfod. The only binary which allows
			to send Node Informations request is ping6 (I have
			not discovered programs which handle these information).
		</p>
		<p>
			If we install the ninfod server on all systems we will
			be able to get all wanted information with the ping6 utility,
			but this is not a very way.
		</p>
		<p>
			The solution is therefore to use a dedicated server which
			listen for icmp-v6 message and if some messages are
			detected to query the wanted information.
		</p>
		<h3>ninsd</h3>
		<p>
			Ninsd (None Information Name Server Daemon) is such a daemon which
			listen on the router advertisement messages and if a new
			system is recognised, look for the IPv6 adress and name of
			the systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two approach are primary possible:
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li>
					<p>ninsd is installed on all systems and act as helper
				    for the DNS resolver.
				    </p>
				</li>
				<li><p>ninsd is installed on the server and provide a normal
				   name server as bind with the name and address of the
				   newly detected systems.
				   </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The second approach what choosed, this implies that the
			name server and ninsd are running on the same machine. The
			server address is "::1" so that we will not have troubles
			if an update come from global addresses. In order to
			work ninsd require that the router advertisement daemon
			radvd work also if the adress assignement is done by dhcp.
			If you have a subrouter you will also be able to update
			the name server.
		</p>
		<h3>NetworkManager and /etc/resolv.conf</h3>
		<p>
			The NetworkManager (at least on the Ubuntu 11.04 used for
			tests) don't update the file resolv.conf if the network
			what plugged out and the in. Due to this the file resolv.conf
			don't contain valid informations.
		</p>
		<h3>Rdnssd</h3>
		<p>
			The actual version of rdnssd don't taken into account the
			domain search list which can be provided by <strong>radvd</strong>.
		</p>
		<h3>Radvc</h3>
		<p>
			The <strong>radvc</strong> daemon what created in order to remedy to this.
			In case the connection is lost, the kernel will send some
			messages to the radvd daemon which will send an router
			advertissement message. This message contain enough informations
			in order to build the file /etc/resolv.conf. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that <strong>rdnssd</strong> will be able to update
			the domain search list for in the future (at this time we have
			the version 1.0.2) and therefore will obsolete <strong>radvc</strong>.
		</p>
		<h2>Features</h2>
		<p>
			Ninsd make some assumptions which will not be a problem within
			a normal home environment but may cause problems in corporate
			deployement.
			<ul>
				<li>
					The domain for DDNS must be the first domain stated into
					the radvd search list
				</li>
				<li>
					Multiple global IPv6 adresses are not supported.
				</li>
				<li>
					The name of the clients shall be unique within the network
					but if there a are not unique the DNS name will be 
					append by -[a-z].
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			For the use within your small office or at home you will benefit
			from:
			<ul>
				<li>Support for name server which support some kind of update.</li>
				<li>Support for DNS64/NAT64 with tayga.</li>
				<li>Access from IPv6/IPv4 to IPv4/IPv6 devices, if tayga
				   is installed.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Clients don't need special configuration, only 2 little
				    utilities are to be installed.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Network example</h2>
		<div style="width:28em;margin:auto;">
			<img src="nins.png" alt="Network example" title="Network example" style="width:100%;">
		</div>
		<p>
			The CPE provide Router adverstisement, the DHCP (IPv4) server is disabled.
			The DHCPv6 Server may work, the priority is to be set to a level less as
			the priority for the DHCPv6 Server on our own DNS system. I recommand to
			use dnsmasq.
		</p>
		<p>
			The PC with subnet act as router and use a dhcp forwarder (from the
			same author as dnsmasq. The client for the PC with subnet will get
			there IPv6 Adress via SLAAC or DHCPv6 according to the configuration
			of dnsmasq, the local radvd process and the ability of the client.
		</p>
		<p>
			IPv4 Systeme within the subnet get the IPv4 Adresse via DHCP from the
			main DNS/DHCP server and possibly also there IPv6 Address.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ninsd daemon on the subnet server send the update data via
			a script which use nc, ncat or netcat. The ninsd saemon on the
			dns sever get these informations and update the name server.
		</p>
		<h2>Configuration for our example network: Name server</h2>
		<p>
			The name server is a rasperrypi which has a low power
			consumption and enough has enough performance for our
			tasks.
