The script tinc-up and tinc-down are for
the VPN client.

This will make shure that if the client is
not configured with a static address but
via the SLAAC (State Less Automatic Address Congiguration)
or DHCP v6 the route to the server VPN interface
is set correctly.

The binary radvc listen on Router Advertisement and,
if the expected information are delivered, create a
new resolv.conf file which allows to use the LAN name
server.

The binary set_route check if the VPN interface
has got a global IPv6 addresse and then call the
script /etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-slaac which will
set forwarding for this interface and set the
route for the whole LAN network (typically /48 or /56).
The gateway addresse is expected to be the
/64 subnet for the VPN interface and a fixed suffix

64 SUBNET = 2001:db8:1234:4568::/64
SERVER ADDRESSE 2001:db8:1234:5678::abcd

The VPN slient netwotk device will get for example
the addresse 2001:db8:1234:4568:1:2ff:fe03:4

The /48 subnet will be 2001:db8:1234::
The /64 subnet will be 2001:db8:1234:4568::

The server addresse (gateway can now be set to
2001:db8:1234:4568::abcd

The needed variable are passed via the environment
from the binary set_route. You must foreseen the
correct value if there don't correspond to the
expected value. See set_route.8.
