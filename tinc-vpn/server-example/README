The script tinc-up and tinc-down are example
which shall work for Linux systems.

The file tinc-up try to get all necessary parameters
from the device attached on the local network.
the expected configuration is as folloe:

The interface what set up and the addresse what
set with for exampe:

ip ad ad 2001:db8:beef::1 dev eth0

The route what set with

ip ro ad  2001:db8:beef::/64 via 2001:db8:beef::1 dev eth0

There are not more than a global address and if so the route
for furher addresse what not set via this other addresss.

If this don't correspond to yout system the script will fail

You must also set the following variables

MN_IF=eth0             # the main interface to the LAN
VPN_SUBNET_NR=3        # the subnet forseen for VPN
VPN_SERVER_SUFFIX=1    # The adresse of the VPN tap is the <prefix>::$VPN_SERVER_SUFFIX
SEARCH_LIST=localnet   # The domain name for your LAN
