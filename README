ninsd
-----

Ninsd is a little daemon which ask clients of the
local network for IPv6 address and name. After these
data are collected the name server is updated and
the clients can be addressed by name. You may use
different DNS server (dnsmasq, unbound) which allow
some kind of updating even if they don't support
DHCP-v6.

Ninsd is to be installed on the same machine as the
name server and on the clients you must install
ninfod (https://github.com/yaegashi/ninfod)


radvc
-----

The daemon rdnssd which is provided by many Linux
distribution don't know at this time the domain search
list, this will be added on the next version. For now
you should use radvc on you clients.

set_route
---------

This program shall be used by tinc on the client
and you have an IPv6 tunnel over IPv6.

Windows
-------

There is no support for Node Information queries
within Windows. The directory wniqd contain a little
server which will allow to ask the Windows systems
for the global IPv6, the host name and possibly the
IPv4 address. This implementation don't cover all
specifications for RFC 4620 but is sufficient in order
to perform an update of the name server.
