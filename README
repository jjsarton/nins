ninsd
-----

Ninsd is a little daemon which ask clients of the
local network for IPv6 adress and name. After these
data are collected the name server is updated and
the clients can be adressed by name. You may use
different DNS server (dnsmasq, unbound) which allow
some kind of updating even if they don't support
DHCP-v6.

Ninsd is to be installed on the same machine as the
name server and on the clients you must install
ninfod (https://github.com/yaegashi/ninfod)


radvc
-----

The daemon rdnssd which is provided by many Linux
distribution don't know at this time the domain search
list, this will be added on the next version. For now
you should use radvc on you clients.
