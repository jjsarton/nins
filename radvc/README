Radvc
-----

Radvc is a little helper which will generate a new
/etc/resolv.conf file. In order to avoid problems if
we have multiple instance of radvc we will include
the search ans servername entries from previous file. 

This programm shall compile on all Linux based systems.

Install

Log as root with su or sudo -s and call:

make install

Thats all,

Firewall and ninfod
-------------------
If you use ninfod and radvc on a SuSE distribution, you may have
problems due to the very restrictive icmpv6 handling of the
SuSEfirewall2. If so, you have to edit the file /sbin/SuSEfirewall2.
You must edit the line stateless_icmpv6_types="... and insert the
value 139 at the end of the assigned string (openSuSE 12.2).
